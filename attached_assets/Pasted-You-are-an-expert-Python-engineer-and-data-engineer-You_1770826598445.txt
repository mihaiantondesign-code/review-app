You are an expert Python engineer and data engineer.

Your task is to PLAN FIRST and then IMPLEMENT a small, reliable Python project on Replit that:

GOAL
- Fetches Apple App Store user reviews using Apple’s public RSS JSON feed (NOT HTML scraping)
- Extracts user-written review text (full comment), title, rating, date, author, and app version
- Filters reviews to ONLY the last 365 days
- Categorizes reviews by rating (1–5 stars)
- Exports the results to an Excel (.xlsx) file
- Runs correctly in Replit (Python repl)

STRICT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT scrape App Store web pages
- Use ONLY the Apple RSS JSON feed
- Do NOT use unofficial APIs or paid services
- Do NOT require API keys
- Do NOT use AI/LLM calls at runtime
- Keep the code simple, readable, and robust
- Use only these libraries:
  - requests
  - pandas
  - openpyxl

INPUT CONFIGURATION
- App Store App ID must be configurable at the top of the script
- Country code must be configurable (default: "it")
- Maximum number of RSS pages must be configurable
- Output filename must be configurable

APPLE RSS FEED FORMAT
Base URL pattern:
https://itunes.apple.com/{country}/rss/customerreviews/id={APP_ID}/sortBy=mostRecent/json

Pagination:
- First page: base URL
- Next pages: append /page={page_number}

IMPORTANT FEED DETAILS
- The first "entry" in the feed is app metadata and must be skipped
- Review text is in: entry["content"]["label"]
- Review title is in: entry["title"]["label"]
- Rating is in: entry["im:rating"]["label"]
- Review date is in: entry["updated"]["label"] (ISO format)
- Author is in: entry["author"]["name"]["label"]
- App version may be missing and must be handled safely

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Fetch pages sequentially until:
   - max pages is reached OR
   - no more valid review entries are returned
2. Parse reviews safely with try/except
3. Convert dates to Python datetime
4. Filter out reviews older than 365 days
5. Store results in a pandas DataFrame
6. Sort reviews by date descending
7. Export to Excel with:
   - One sheet per rating (1_stelle, 2_stelle, etc.)
   - Columns:
     date, rating, title, review, author, version

OUTPUT
- A single Excel file saved in the Replit file system
- Print a clear success message showing:
  - number of reviews saved
  - output filename

PROJECT STRUCTURE
- main.py (single file is fine)
- requirements.txt (requests, pandas, openpyxl)

PROCESS REQUIREMENT
Before writing code:
1. Briefly outline the execution plan in comments
2. Then write the complete working code
3. Do not leave TODOs
4. Do not include explanations outside comments in the code

QUALITY BAR
- Code must run on first execution in Replit
- No placeholder values except APP_ID
- Clear variable names
- Defensive programming for missing fields
- Minimal but clean logging (print statements)

DELIVERABLE
Produce the final `main.py` content and, if needed, `requirements.txt`.
